This library encapsulate SNMP functions in a natural and easy-to-use API set. All three versions of SNMP protocols (v1, v2c, and v3) are fully supported. 

The source code is released under MIT/X11, and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/lextm/sharpsnmplib). 

As true cross platform, it now supports all major platforms including .NET Framework 4.0/4.5/4.5.1, Mono 3.*, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android.

## Release Notes
### Version 8.5 (Jan 25, 2014)
 
This is the initial release on Xamarin Component Store, which is primarily a refresh of our 8.0 release for all platforms plus a few minor changes to adapt to #SNMP Pro. Use it with caution as it should be marked as a beta quality package for evaluation purposes.

The 9.0 release is going to be released in the next few days to provide a stable set of API.
